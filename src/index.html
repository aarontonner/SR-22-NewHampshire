It serves as proof to the state that you have the necessary liability coverage. This requirement is often imposed on high-risk drivers as a means of ensuring they carry sufficient insurance. The process involves your insurance provider filing an SR-22 form with the New Hampshire Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on your behalf, which confirms that you are adequately insured.
